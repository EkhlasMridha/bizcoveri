3. Page TITLE missing on almost all pages

4. Even after login, user name and company does not show up on the right top corner

5. Schedule meetings page is still not there

6. EVERY PAGE should have a STATIC data model using which you shall populate data, I shall refresh the model later using API calls


Past feedback
---------------

All pages should redirect to homepage or login page, when session has expired or not logged in
example: http://localhost:4200/dashboard opens the dashboard page with user underfined, here it should take us to sign in page

If user cannot sign in, please show appropriate message

Lots of errors as I can see in the console window

Still shows undefined user post successful login

username, email and pwd...all should be there in the login page

Post login as client, if CLIENT details do not exist, it should open page 18 and not 19

Page 18 should have a header as given in Figma design

Solution page buttons like start project, vendor registration etc do not work as designed in figma prototype
